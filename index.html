    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in cybersecurity, 
      I am eager to apply my skills and passion to help protect critical systems and networks against evolving threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my academic journey at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, and through hands-on experience as an 
      IT Security Engineer at Cis Automation and a Cybersecurity Intern at Hacktify, I developed a strong foundation in 
      network and application penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and security auditing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold certifications like eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) and Certified Red Team Analyst (CRTA), 
      which reinforce my technical capabilities and commitment to continuous growth.
